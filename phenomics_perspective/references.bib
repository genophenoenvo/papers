We also show how these logical definitions can be used for data integration when combined with a unified multi-species anatomy ontology.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology – the timing of plant life-cycle events, such as ﬂowering or leaﬁng out – plays a fundamental role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, including human agricultural systems. Because plant phenology is often linked with climatic variables, there is widespread interest in developing a deeper understanding of global plant phenology patterns and trends. Although phenology data from around the world are currently available, truly global analyses of plant phenology have so far been difﬁcult because the organizations producing large-scale phenology data are using nonstandardized terminologies and metrics during data collection and data processing. To address this problem, we have developed the Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO). The PPO provides the standardized vocabulary and semantic framework that is needed for large-scale integration of heterogeneous plant phenology data. Here, we describe the PPO, and we also report preliminary results of using the PPO and a new data processing pipeline to build a large dataset of phenology information from North America and Europe.},

Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a unique database where users are allowed to query and explore the power of genomic colinearity and comparative genomics for genetic and genomic studies on plant genomes. Gramene presents a wholesome perspective by assimilating data from a broad range of publicly available data sources for cereals like rice, sorghum, maize, wild rice, wheat, oats, barley, and other agronomically important crop plants such as poplar and grape, and the model plant Arabidopsis. As part of the process, it preserves the original data, but also reanalyzes for integration into several knowledge domains of maps, markers, genes, proteins, pathways, phenotypes, including Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and genetic diversity/natural variation. This allows researchers to use this information resource to decipher the known and predicted interactions between the components of biological systems, and how these interactions regulate plant development. Using examples from rice, this article describes how the database can be helpful to researchers representing an array of knowledge domains ranging from plant biology, plant breeding, molecular biology, genomics, biochemistry, genetics, bioinformatics, and phylogenomics.},
